# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
       
           
       
### How Amazon EC2 works
1. **Launch**          
selecting a template with basic configurations include the operating system, application server, applications.         
2. **Connect**
3. **Use**
         
 
             
### Amazon EC2 instance types
         
1. **General purpose instances**     
* provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.
* such as : application servers, gaming servers, backend servers for enterprise applications, small and medium databases.           
          
2. **Compute optimized instances**
* ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.
* for batch processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.        
            
3. **Memory optimized instances**    
* for workloads that process large datasets in memory.
* enable you to run workloads with high memory needs and receive great performance.      
4. **Accelerated computing instances**   
* for floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching.
* such as graphics applications, game streaming, and application streaming.    
      
5. **Storage optimized instances**       
* require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.
* include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high frequency online transacion processing systems.
